 *
 *
 *   OFFICIAL SITE
 *   -------------
 *   The official distribution site for WATTCP (and many other TCP goodies)
 *   is dorm.rutgers.edu in pub/msdos/wattcp  (thanks Jim!)
 *
 *   That is where I upload the latest libraries, my own free applications
 *   and other applications I have collected and find useful.
 *
 *
 *   DOCUMENTATION
 *   -------------
 *   A programmer's reference manual I wrote is now available from the
 *   publisher.  They provide no additional support and cannot help
 *   you with any aspect of the software.  But they do pay a royalty
 *   to me which has been used to compensate my costs for developing
 *   this software and extending it, so I am very appreciative.
 *
 *   That manual is copyrighted and protected by international law.
 *   It may not be copied without the authors permission.  And its
 *   sale does not constitute a warranty or an automatic license to
 *   use WATTCP beyond the terms described in this file.
 *
 *   For payment they accept credit cards, cheques, checks, money orders
 *   and P.O.s.  Credit card orders can be processed over the telephone.
 *
 *   Note that they are located in Canada and mail to them MAY REQUIRE
 *   additional postage depending on where you live.  Also, be sure to
 *   use the entire address, including the last line.  Canada is a heck
 *   of a large country and that line really makes a difference.
 *
 *   Prices are listed in US dollars for convienence to our many
 *   international readers.  The value charged on credit card items
 *   will be the equivalent in Canadian dollars at the exchange rate
 *   of the day.
 *

 *  Developers' Meeting Place

 *  comp.protocols.tcp-ip.ibmpc Usenet newgroup, and there
 *  are several people there who can answer most any question.
 *
 *  If you need my personal attention (I seem to have less and less
 *  available) you will have to Email my address below.  I cannot take
 *  phone calls relating to WATTCP at my place of occupation.
