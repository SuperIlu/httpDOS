Due to various incompatibilities between various make programs for PC
systems as well as differing notions of what the path separator should
be, I have decided that the best and most maintainable approach is to
create a master makefile that that consists of system/compiler/make
sections from which the approriate makefile is constructed.  The
easiest way to do this is to run the master makefile through a
preprocessor.  To this end, I have created a master makefile for
DOS/OS2 systems called makefile.all.  This makefile is processed by
the DOS executable mkmake.exe to produce various makefiles.  For
example, 

    mkmake BCC < makefile.all > makefile
    
produces a makefile suitable for BCC, whereas 

    mkmake OS2EMX < makefile.all > makefile
    
produces a makefile for OS2 assuming that EMX is the compiler.

Use

    mkmake < makefile.all | more
    
for more information.  (Better yet, look at makefile.all; it is best
viewed with a folding editor).
