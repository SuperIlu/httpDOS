      An important note: The current version of NOISE.SYS is not entirely
      compatible with software written to use versions prior to 0.4!

      The driver now implements two devices, /dev/random and /dev/urandom.
      The latter (/dev/urandom) is equivalent to the older /dev/random
      device, and will return as many bytes as are requested.

      /dev/random will not return more bytes than the estimated entropy
      in the pool.  It is meant for key-generation.

      Please make any necessary changes to your software.

      Because of these changes, most dynamic device-driver loaders cannot
      handle drivers like NOISE.SYS without crashing miserably.  This is
      not because of any weird or undocumented features in the driver,
      but because the authors of the respective utilities did not bother
      to account for chained drivers, even though DOS has no problems
      with them.  They load fine when placed in the CONFIG.SYS file.

      This distribution contains source code patches for three of the
      utilities, DEVLOD, DRVLOAD and Idrv, which will enable them to load
      this and similar drivers properly, as well as work on DOS 6.

      You will have to get a copy of the original source code and apply
      the patches yourself, since the sources are copyrighted.

      This is not an endorsement for or disparagement against any
      program or author.  Those were the only two utilities which are
      distributed with source code (and the moral to the story is....)

      Writing the patch was a very simple exercise compared to writing
      my own utility.

      No guarantees or warranties are made, etc. Use them at your own risk.

      As always, please read the documentation!
