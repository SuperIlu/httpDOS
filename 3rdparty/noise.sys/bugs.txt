Potential bugbears:

        The devices may be buggy when used from 32-bit apps (Win95 or
        Win32s).  Be cautious about using this driver until a VxD
        (tentatively VRANDOM.386, VxD-Id 3996h)  is released.

        The bug using the console's COPY command appears to be fixed.

        Building the driver with __CPU set to 5 (i586) uses the "rdtsc"
        (Read Timestamp Counter) instruction as an entropy source, which
        may cause a protection fault when run under Windows or OS/2.
        Oddly, this appears to run with no apparent problems when QEMM
        (or allegedly 386MAX) is loaded instead of HIMEM.SYS.

        Even then, when selecting "Restart..." under the "Shutdown"
        menu in Win95, you may get an exception from QEMM.

        The above is for Pentium (i586) processors; PentiumPro (i686)
        processors, I've been told, may handle "rdtsc" differently.

        However, there may be other problems with NOISE.SYS when used
        with QEMM.  On a 486DX4 running MS-DOS 5.0 and AMI BIOS (1992)
        there have been many  machine exceptions, though generally tied
        to using an old pager utility.  This problem has not occurred
        on a Pentium running Win95 and Award BIOS using the same pager.

        Since the clock drift sampling uses the BIOS Event Wait timer on
        a continuous basis, there may be conflicts with other programs
        that also use the timer.  (The /c option is disabled by default:
        you will have to rebuild the driver if you want to enable it.)

Reporting bugs:

        Feel free to study the source code and look for bugs or poor
        implementations that I may have missed.
